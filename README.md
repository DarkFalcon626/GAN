# DCGAN 

## Overview
This project sets out to create and test a basic Deep Convolutionl Generative Adversarial Network to generate images, in this case we will generate images of birds. A DCGAN uses two networks a generative network comprised of transposed convolation layers with ReLU activation functions, and a discriminator network of convolation layers with leaky ReLU activation and a single fully connected layer with a softmax activation. The generator network takes in a vector of random numbers (or noise) and produces a tensor corresponding to a image representing the dataset in which the models are being trained on. The discriminator networks job is to take in a tensor representing an image and determining if the image is real (i.e. part of the dataset) or fake (i.e. generated by the generative network). The networks aim to compete against each other the discrimintor trains to get better at detecting fakes while the generator trains to produce more realistic images to fool the discrimintor network. Hence the name generative advisarial network.

## The Network 
The network has two parts the generative network and the discrimintor network.
